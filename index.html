        Hello! I hope you have found this page well. My name is Nick. I am an
        aspiring Technical and Content Writer. I have always been drawn to
        creating and helping people learn and understand. In my previous line of
        work I was not able to do both at the same time and I did not understand
        that creating things the help people is something I have a stronf
        affinity for. So in 2020 I left my career in the financial industry, and
        with the help of a wise Career Counselor discovered the world of
        Technical and Content Writing.
